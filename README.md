# inventory

Fullstack Application built with the PostgreSQL, Express, ReactJS and NodeJS (PERN) stack. JSON Web Token is used for user validation and styling done using Tailwind CSS.

### Possible Use Case
A stocktaking app targeted at neighbourhood shop with the following characteristics:
- Require simple stocktake system
- Infancy stage of technology adoption
- Customer base not on e-commerce platform
- Does not yet have any barcode system
- Staff mainly seniors using mobile (i.e. app has to be simple and mobile responsive)

### Motivation
Through this capstone project, I hope to:
- ReactJS: make a more conscious effort to include reusable components (e.g. button, input, dropdown, etc) for the frontend
- Express & PostgreSQL: recap on the use of Express (e.g. organise endpoints under different controllers) and learn how Express communicate with a SQL database. Gain an idea of how JWT token works with Express for user validation.
- PostgreSQL: practice data modelling and use of SQL for the various endpoints to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) data.

### Approach
 1. [Figma wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/DX7BSDh7fJHDqn5G6TrD9m/Project-4?node-id=0%3A1) was used for planning of features
2. Based on brief idea of required features, identified data required and database design
